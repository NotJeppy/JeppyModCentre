## 🚀 Getting Started

First thing's first: Online Play
Nintendo officially discontinued the servers for games like Mario Kart 7 and Super Smash Bros. 3DS. 
However, fans have created a server that allows you to continue playing online. 
First, go to the 'Nimbus' app that I have installed onto your system.
Make sure that you switch it to 'Pretendo'.
Then, go to https://pretendo.network/account/register to register an account.
Once you have created an account, go to settings -> Nintendo Network ID and login using your information.
Then, just make sure that you have created a Mii in the Mii Maker. (I have likely made one for you)
Next, just hop in your game with an active internet connection to access online play!

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Can I update my 3DS after modding it?**  
A: Yes – with Luma3DS installed, it's safe to update your system normally through System Settings. ()

**Q: Is it illegal to mod my 3DS?**  
A: Modding itself isn’t illegal. However, **piracy is**. Only use backups of games you legally own. (legal reasons)

**Q: Can I brick my system?**  
A: It’s rare if you follow trusted guides. Always backup your NAND with GodMode9 just in case. (You should not have to worry about this as I have already modded your system.)
